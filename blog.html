            <p class="title">does it matter to use relative sizes for styling?</p>
            <hr>

            <article>
                <p>before answering the question i would like you to think of building a hospital. Now forget all the details and focus on one question: <em>"Would you like your hospital to have ramps and elevators?"</em></p>
                <p>the answer to both questions would be <em>yes</em>. Of course the second one is somewhat obvious- who would build a hospital that is inaccessible to the patients? Right! The thing is the first question has a very similar logic as to why webpages should be styled using relative sizes.</p>
                <p>setting the sizes for visual components such as spacing, font size, and the like is simply not considering the end-users. When a person creates a websites, the targets of the website should be all of the population and among that population are people who are in their 60s with visual impairments who may not be able to see the fixed pixel size that the site used.</p>
                <p>while the default <em>medium</em> font size is not usually changed by the end-users- and even less frequently by 60 year-olds. However it is possible to do so in all browsers.
                    When the users change that font, if the styling of the website uses fixed sizes pixels to specify sizes, then there would be no effect meaning the user is not going to enjoy browsing the site due to its uncomfortable sizing. On the other hand if the site uses relative sizes like <strong>em, rem, and %</strong> which depend on the default size of the browser to style the site, it means that whenever the default font of the browser changes along with it changes the content on the website.
                </p>
                <p>to formally address the topic of the article, yes it matters a lot to use relative sizes for styling</p>

            <p class = "title">how does a browser interpret <em>pixels (px)</em></p>
            <hr>
            <article>
                <p>to look at how a browser understands pixel units, like 200px and 16px, we first need to understand about what pixels are and how they work.
                    People usually misunderstand pixels to be little squares on the screen. well unfortunately, pixels are not little squares. Rather pixels are point samples- each pixel exists at a point and consists of three samples, one for each primary color contributing to the picture at the sampling point. It is the rectilinear array of point samples/pixels that forms human understandable objects on the screen.
                </p>
                <p>now that you know about pixels even if only just a little, it should be obvious how browsers interpret the measurements from HTML and CSS. Just incase though, I'll explain it. </p>
                <p>well first of all, all browsers have a default styling size which is set to "medium" at 16 pixels and can be tweaked to the users' liking.
                    Now this size is applied to everything in between the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code> tags which is then inherited by all the other child tags. 
                    when a person writes code that looks like this:
                    <p><code title="HTML code snippet">&lt;div id = "special" width = "200px"&gt;Pixels are not squares!&lt;/div&gt;</code></p>
                    or this
                    <p><code title="CSS code snippet">#special{width : 200px;}</code></p>
                    both of which adjust the width of an object, the default style size applied to the html is overridden by the new one-200px 
                </p>
                <p>so what previously took up 16 pixels on the display would now take 200 pixels as its display across the screen.</p>

            <p class = "title">what's new in CSS3</p>
            <hr>
            <article>
                <p>CSS3 is the latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets markup-language and aims at extending CSS2.1.</p>
                <p class="h1"><strong>1. CSS3 selectors</strong></p>
                <p>originally, CSS allowed the matching of elements by type, class and/or ID.
                     CSS2.1 added pseudo-elements, pseudo-classes, and combinators.
                     Now, with CSS3, it's possible to target even more elements on the page with a wide range of selectors
                </p>
                <p class="h2">A. Attribute selectors</p>
                <p>CSS2 introduced several attribute selectors. These allow for matching elements based on their attributes. CSS3 expands upon those attribute selectors.Three more attribute selectors were added in CSS3; they allow for substring selection.</p>
                <p class="h3">
                    1. Matches any element <code>E</code> whose attribute <code>attr</code> starts with a value <code>val</code>. In other words the val matches the beginning of the attribute value.
                </p>
                <code class="h3">E[attr^=val]{...}</code>


                <p class="h3">
                    2. Matches any element <code>E</code> whose attribute <code>attr</code> ends with a value <code>val</code>. In other words the val matches the end of the attribute value.
                </p>
                <code class="h3">E[attr$=val]{...}</code>
            

                <p>
                    3. Matches any element <code>E</code> whose attribute <code>attr</code> matches with a value <code>val</code> anywhere within the attribute. It is similar to <code>E[attr~=val]</code>, except the <code>val</code> can be part of a word.
                </p>
                <code>E[attr^=val]{...}</code>
                
                <p class="h2">B. pseudo-classes</p>
                <p>
                    It’s likely that you’re already familiar with some of the user interaction pseudo-classes,namely <code>:link</code>, <code>:visited</code>, <code>:hover</code>, <code>:active</code>, and <code>:focus</code>.
A few more pseudo-class selectors were added in CSS3. One is the :root selector, which allows designers to point to the root element of a document. In HTML, it would be <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>.
                </p>
                <code>:root{overflow:auto;}</code>
                <p>As a complement to the <code>:first-child</code> selector, the <code>:last-child</code> was added. With it one can select the last element named of a parent element. For a site with articles contained in <code>&lt;div class=’article’&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</code> tags, where each has a last paragraph with some information that needs to be uniformly stylized, this rule would change the font for last paragraph of each article.</p>
                <code>
                    div.article > p:last-child{font-style: italic;}
                </code>
                <p>A new user interaction pseudo-class selector was added, the :target selector. To draw the user’s attention to a span of text when the user clicks on a same-page link, a rule like the first line below would work nicely; the link would look like the second line, the highlighted span like the third.</p>
                <code>span.notice:target{font-size: 2em; font-style: bold;}
                <br>&lt;a href='#section2'&gt;Section 2&lt;/a&gt;
                <br>&lt;p id='section2'&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                <p>A functional notation for selecting specified elements that fail a test has been created. The negation pseudo-class selector, <code>:not</code> can be coupled with almost any other selector that has been implemented. For example to put a border around images that don’t have a border specified, use a rule like this.</p>
                <code>img:not([border]){border: 1;}
                </code>




                <p class="h1"><strong>2. CSS3 Colors</strong></p>

                <p>
                    CSS3 brings with it support for some new ways of describing colours . Prior to CSS3, we almost always declared colours using the hexadecimal format (#FFF, or #FFFFFF for white). It was also possible to declare colours using the rgb() notation, providing either integers (0–255) or percentages.</p>
                <p>
                    The color keyword list has been extended in the CSS3 color module to include 147 additional keyword colors (that are generally well supported), CSS3 also provides us with a number of other options: <abbr title="hue, saturation, lightness">HSL</abbr>, <abbr title="hue, saturation, lightness, Alpha">HSLA</abbr>, and <abbr title="Red, Green, Blue, Alpha">RGBA</abbr>. The most notable change with these new color types is the ability to declare semitransparent colors.
                </p>
                <p class="h2">1. <abbr title="Red, Green, Blue, Alpha">RGBA</abbr></p>
                <p><abbr title="Red, Green, Blue, Alpha">RGBA</abbr> works just like RGB, except that it adds a fourth value: alpha, the opacity level or alpha transparency level. The first three values still represent red, green, and blue. For the alpha value, 1 means fully opaque, 0 is fully transparent, and 0.5 is 50% opaque. You can use any number between 0 and 1 inclusively.</p>
                <p class="h2">2. <abbr title="hue, saturation, lightness">HSL</abbr> and <abbr title="hue, saturation, lightness, Alpha">HSLA</abbr> </p>
                <p>hue, saturation, lightness stands for hue, saturation, and lightness. Unlike RGB, where you need to manipulate the saturation or brightness of a color by changing all three color values in concert, with hue, saturation, lightness you can tweak either just the saturation or the lightness while keeping the same base hue. The syntax for hue, saturation, lightness comprises an integer value for hue, and percentage values for saturation and lightness.</p>
                <p>The hsl( ) declaration accepts three values:</p>
                <p>The hue in degrees from 0 to 359. Some examples are: 0 = red, 60 = yellow, 120= green, 180 = cyan, 240 = blue, and 300 = magenta.</p>
                <p>The saturation as a percentage with 100% being the norm. Saturation of 100% will be the full hue, and saturation of 0 will give you a shade of gray essentially causing the hue value to be ignored.</p>
                <p>A percentage for lightness with 50% being the norm. A lightness of 100% will be white, 50% will be the actual hue, and 0% will be black.</p>
                <p>The a in hsla( ) here also functions the same way as in rgba( )</p>
                <p class="h2">3.Opacity</p>
                <p>In addition to specifying transparency with HSLA and RGBA colors (and soon, eight-digit hexadecimal values), CSS3 provides us with the opacity property. opacity sets the opaqueness of the element on which it’s declared, similar to alpha.</p>
                <p>Let’s look at an example:</p>
                <code>div.halfopaque {<br>
                    background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);<br>
                    opacity: 0.5;<br>
                    color: #000000;<br>
                    }<br>
                    div.halfalpha {<br>
                    background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);<br>
                    color: #000000;<br>
                    }</code>
                    <p>Though the usage of both alpha and opacity notations seem similar, when you look at it, there is a key difference in their function.
                    </p><p>   While opacity sets the opacity value for an element and all of its children, a semitransparent RGBA or HSLA color has no impact on the element’s other CSS properties or descendants.</p>
